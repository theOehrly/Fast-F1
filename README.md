#### Installation in Pyodide, JupyterLite and other WASM-based environments

FastF1 should be mostly compatible with Pyodide and other WASM-based 
environments, although this is not extensively tested. Currently, the 
installation and usage require some additional steps. You can find more 
information and a guide in
[this external repository](https://github.com/f1datajunkie/jupyterlite-fastf1)
and the discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1/issues/667).

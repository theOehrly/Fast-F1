    Match a query string to a reference list of lists of strings using fuzzy
    string matching.

    The reference is a list of sub-lists where each sub-list represents one
    element. The sub-lists contain one or multiple feature strings. The idea is
    that each element can be described by multiple feature strings. The
    function tries to find the best matching element in the reference list
    for the given query string.

    The function first checks for exact substring matches with the individual
    feature strings. If there is exactly one sub-list, where the query
    is a substring of a feature string, this index is returned as an
    "accurate match". Else, the function uses fuzzy string matching to find the
    best match in the reference list. The index of the best matching element is
    then returned as an "inaccurate match".

    Args:
        query: The query string to match.
        reference: A list of lists where each sub-list contains one or multiple
            feature strings describing an element.
        abs_confidence: The minimum absolute confidence that the match must
            have when fuzzy matched. Must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where
              1.0 is equivalent to a perfect match. Set to 0.0 to disable.
              If the best match has a lower confidence, a KeyError is raised.
        rel_confidence: The minimum relative confidence that the match must
            have (compared with the second-best match). Must be a value greater
            than 0.0, where 0.5 would mean that the best match must have a 50%
            higher score than the second-best match. Set to 0.0 to disable.
            If the best match has a lower relative confidence, a KeyError is
            raised.

    Returns:
        (int, bool): Index of the best matching element in the
            reference (outer) list and a boolean indicating if the match is
            accurate or not.

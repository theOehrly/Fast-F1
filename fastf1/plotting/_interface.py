    """
    Get a plotting style that is unique for a driver based on the driver's
    abbreviation or based on a recognizable and identifiable part of the
    driver's name.

    This function simplifies the task of generating unique and easily
    distinguishable visual styles for multiple drivers in a plot.
    Primarily, the focus is on plotting with Matplotlib, but it is possible
    to customize the behaviour for compatibility with other plotting libraries.

    The general idea for creating visual styles is as follows:

    1. Set the primary color of the style to the color of the team for
       which a driver is driving. This may be the line color in a line plot,
       the marker color in a scatter plot, and so on.

    2. Use one or multiple other styling options (line style, markers, ...)
       to differentiate drivers in the same team.

    .. note:: It cannot be guaranteed that the styles are consistent throughout
        a full season, especially in case of driver changes within a team.


    **Option 1**: Rely on built-in styling options

    By default, this function supports the following Matplotlib plot arguments:
    ``linestyle``, ``marker``, ``color``, ``facecolor``, ``edgecolor`` as well
    as almost all other color-related arguments.

    The styling options include one color for each team and up to four
    different line styles and marker styles within a team. That means that no
    more than four different drivers are supported for a team in a single
    session. This should be sufficent in almost all scenarios.

    The following example obtains the driver style for Alonso and Stroll in a
    race in the 2023 season. The drivers should be represented using the
    ``color`` and ``marker`` arguments, as may be useful in a scatter plot.
    Both drivers were driving for the Aston Martin team, therefore, both
    automatically get assigned the same color, which is the Aston Martin team
    color. But both drivers get assigned a different marker style, so they can
    be uniquely identified in the plot.

    Example:

    .. doctest::

        >>> from fastf1 import get_session
        >>> from fastf1.plotting import get_driver_style
        >>> session = get_session(2023, 10, 'R')
        >>> get_driver_style('ALO', ['color', 'marker'], session)
        {'color': '#00665e', 'marker': 'x'}
        >>> get_driver_style('STR', ['color', 'marker'], session)
        {'color': '#00665e', 'marker': 'o'}

    **Option 2**: Provide a custom list of styling variants

    To allow for almost unlimited styling options, it is possible to specify
    custom styling variants. These are not tied to any specific plotting
    library.

    In the following example, a list with two custom stlyes is defined that are
    then used to generate driver specific styles. Each style is represented by
    a dictionary of keywords and values.

    The first driver in a team gets assigned the first style, the second driver
    the second style and so on (if there are more than two drivers). It is
    necessary to define at least as many styles as there are drivers in a team.

    The following things need to be noted:

    1. The notion of first or second driver does not refer to any particular
    reference and no specific order for drivers within a team is intended or
    guranteed.

    2. Any color-related key can make use of the "magic" ``'auto'`` value as
    shown with Alonso in this example. When the color value is set to
    ``'auto'`` it will automatically be replaced with the team color for this
    driver. All color keywords that are used in Matplotlib should be recognized
    automatically. You can define custom arguments as color arguments through
    the ``additional_color_kws`` argument.

    3. Each style dictionary can contain arbitrary keys and value. Therefore,
    you are not limited to any particular plotting library.

    Example:

    .. doctest::

        >>> from fastf1 import get_session
        >>> from fastf1.plotting import get_driver_style
        >>> session = get_session(2023, 10, 'R')
        >>> my_styles = [
        ...     {'linestyle': 'solid', 'color': 'auto', 'custom_arg': True},
        ...     {'linestyle': 'dotted', 'color': '#FF0060', 'other_arg': 10}
        ... ]
        >>> get_driver_style('ALO', my_styles, session)
        {'linestyle': 'solid', 'color': '#00665e', 'custom_arg': True}
        >>> get_driver_style('STR', my_styles, session)
        {'linestyle': 'dotted', 'color': '#FF0060', 'other_arg': 10}

    Args:
        identifier: driver abbreviation or recognizable part of the driver name
        style: list of matplotlib plot arguments that should be used for
            styling or a list of custom style dictionaries
        session: the session for which the data should be obtained
        colormap: one of ``'default'``, ``'fastf1'`` or ``'official'``.
            The default colormap is ``'fastf1'``. Use
            :func:`~fastf1.plotting.set_default_colormap` to change it.
        additional_color_kws: A list of keys that should additionally be
            treated as colors. This is most usefull for making the magic
            ``'auto'`` color work with custom styling options.

            characters are converted to their nearest ASCII equivalent)

    This object is created from data that was recorded using
    :class:`~fastf1.livetiming.client.SignalRClient`. It can be passed to
    various api calling functions using the ``livedata`` keyword.

    Usually you will only instantiate this function and pass it to
    other functions.

    See :ref:`livetiming` for more information.

    If you want to load data from multiple files you can simply pass multiple
    filenames::

        livedata = LiveTimingData('file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt')

    The files need to be in chronological order but may overlap. I.e. if the
    last five minutes of file1 are the same as the first 5 minutes of file2
    this will be recognized while loading the data. No duplicate data will
    be loaded.

Installation
============

FastF1 requires Python 3.9 or higher.
It is recommended to install FastF1 using `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install fastf1

You can also install using `conda`:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge fastf1

Alternatively, a wheel or a source distribution can be downloaded from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/fastf1/>`_.

**Installation in Pyodide, JupyterLite and other WASM-based environments**

FastF1 should be mostly compatible with Pyodide and other WASM-based
environments, although this is not extensively tested. Currently, the
installation and usage require some additional steps. You can find more
information and a guide in
`this external repository <https://github.com/f1datajunkie/jupyterlite-fastf1>`_
and the discussion in `this issue <https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1/issues/667>`_.

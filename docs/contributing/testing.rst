Testing
=======

FastF1 uses the pytest_ framework.

The tests are in :file:`fastf1/tests`, and customizations to the pytest
testing infrastructure are in ``fastf1.testing``.

.. _pytest: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/
.. _pytest-xdist: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/


.. _testing_requirements:

Requirements
------------

To run the tests you will need to
:ref:`set up FastF1 for development <installing_for_devs>`.


Running the tests
-----------------

In the root directory of your development repository run::

   python -m pytest


pytest expects the cache directory :file:`test_cache/` to exist. You will have to create it the first time.


pytest can be configured via a lot of `command-line parameters`_. Some
particularly useful ones are:

=============================  ===========
``-v`` or ``--verbose``        Be more verbose
``-n NUM``                     Run tests in parallel over NUM
                               processes (requires pytest-xdist_)
``--capture=no`` or ``-s``     Do not capture stdout
=============================  ===========

To run a single test from the command line, you can provide a file path,
optionally followed by the function separated by two colons, e.g., (tests do
not need to be installed, but FastF1 should be)::

  pytest fastf1/tests/test_events.py::test_event_get_session_date


.. _command-line parameters: http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html


Linting - Code style tests
--------------------------

FastF1 uses Ruff_ and isort_ to ensure that the code has a consistent style and
is easily readable. All code should conform to the guidelines that are defined
by PEP8_.

To check whether your code is formatted correctly, run::

  ruff check .


To check and correct the import order, run::

  python -m isort .

If you have installed the :ref:`pre-commit hooks <pre_commit_hooks>`,
these commands will also be run automatically before each commit.

Github Actions CI Tests
-----------------------

FastF1 uses Github Actions to run the tests on every push to the repository and
when updating a pull request. Usually, you should just let all tests run and
make sure that they are passing.

In rare cases, it may be useful to skip some tests. You can do this by adding
a specific comment to the commit message. The following comments are supported:

- ``[skip-pytest]``: Skip pytest runs on all Python versions
- ``[skip-ruff]``: Skip Ruff code style checks
- ``[skip-isort]``: Skip isort import order checks
- ``[skip-doc-build]``: Skip building the documentation
- ``[skip-readme-test]``: Skip the README render test for PyPI

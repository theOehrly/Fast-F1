Overview over Team Colormaps
----------------------------

Note that the "official" colors that are shown here may be different from
those that are returned by FastF1 at runtime since they are updated from via
the F1 API for each session and may change during the season.

(Colors in the image below are only displayed accurately, when the
documentation website is viewed in light color mode. Use the switcher in the
top right corner to change between light and dark mode.)

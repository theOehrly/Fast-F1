Jolpica-F1 API Interface
========================

.. note::

    This API was previously provided by the Ergast motor racing database (Ergast MRD).
    Ergast was shutdown at the beginning of 2025 and
    `Jolpica-F1 <https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1>`__ took over
    as its successor, providing a replacement API that is drop-in compatible.
    While the module names here have not been changed for backwards
    compatibility, all data is now obtained from Jolpica-F1.


Introduction
------------

This module can be used to interface with the
`Jolpica-F1 <https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1>`__ API (previously Ergast).

The :class:`Ergast` object provides access to all Endpoints of the
Jolpica-F1 API.

The `Rate Limits <https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/blob/main/docs/rate_limits.md>`__
of Jolpica-F1 apply.
FastF1 will handle caching and it will try to enforce rate limits where
possible. For more information on how FastF1 handles caching and rate
limiting see :ref:`rate_limits-caching`.

Result Types
..............

Data can be returned in two different formats:

**Raw Response**

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   ~interface.ErgastRawResponse

This format is a JSON-like representation of the original JSON data (using
``json.load``).

**Flattened into Pandas DataFrames**

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:

   ~interface.ErgastSimpleResponse
   ~interface.ErgastMultiResponse

The complexity of the data that is returned by the API endpoint determines
the exact result type. The return type is documented for each endpoint.

An :class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastSimpleResponse` wraps a Pandas
``DataFrame`` directly.

An :class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastMultiResponse` consists of a
descriptive ``DataFrame``
(:attr:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastMultiResponse.description`)
and a list of ``DataFrames`` that contain the main content of the response
(:attr:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastMultiResponse.content`).


General Options
...............

The following arguments are available as default values on :class:`Ergast` or
individually for each endpoint method:

    - ``result_type`` ('raw' or 'pandas'): Select between RAW responses or
        Pandas DataFrame responses.

    - ``auto_cast`` (`bool`): Select whether all values are automatically
        cast from their default string representation to the most appropriate
        data type.

    - ``limit`` (`int`): Set the limit for the maximum number of results that
        are returned in one request. The server default (30 results) applies
        if this value is not set. The maximum allowed value is 1000 results.


Common Surprises
................

This is a list of things that may be surprising or unexpected for first-time
users.

  - API results are always returned in ascending order. As a result, for
    example, if you query the race schedule without specifying a season, you
    will receive the schedule for the oldest seasons first, starting in 1950.

  - Only some combinations of filter parameters are possible and those vary for
    each API endpoint. FastF1 does not impose restrictions on these
    combinations as the relationships are fairly complex. Instead, an
    :class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastInvalidRequestError` will
    be returned in such a case. The exception will contain the error response
    of the server.


Examples
........

First, import :class:`~fastf1.ergast.Ergast` and create and interface with
all default arguments.

.. doctest::

    >>> from fastf1.ergast import Ergast
    >>> ergast = Ergast()

Simple DataFrame Responses
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Get information about all circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2022.
This is an endpoint that returns an
:class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastSimpleResponse`, meaning one single
DataFrame.


.. doctest::

    >>> response_frame = ergast.get_circuits(season=2022)
    >>> response_frame
            circuitId  ...       country
    0     albert_park  ...     Australia
    1        americas  ...           USA
    2         bahrain  ...       Bahrain
    ...
    19     villeneuve  ...        Canada
    20     yas_marina  ...           UAE
    21      zandvoort  ...   Netherlands
    <BLANKLINE>
    [22 rows x 7 columns]

Raw Responses
:::::::::::::

To get the raw data instead of the DataFrame result, specify the return type
as 'raw':

.. doctest::

  >>> ergast.get_circuits(season=2022, result_type='raw')  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
  [{'circuitId': 'albert_park',
    'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park_Circuit',
    'circuitName': 'Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit',
    'Location': {'lat': -37.8497,
                 'long': 144.968,
                 'locality': 'Melbourne',
                 'country': 'Australia'}},
  ...]

Note that FastF1's "raw" response is not actually the complete JSON response
that the API provides. Instead, only the actual data part of the response is
returned while metadata (version, query parameters, response length, ...)
are not included.

Renamed Keys and Type Casting
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the response DataFrame, some keys are renamed from the raw result
so that all column names are unique when flattening more complex responses.
Compare the column names from the result data frame with the raw response above
and note that 'url' has changed to 'circuitUrl' (Responses can include other
URLs as well).

.. doctest::

  >>> response_frame.columns
  Index(['circuitId', 'circuitUrl', 'circuitName', 'lat', 'long', 'locality',
         'country'],
        dtype='object')

Also note, that by default all values will automatically be cast to the most
suitable data type. Ergast itself does provide all values as string, though.
Automatic type casting can be very useful because most of the time it will
make it easier to work with the data. But it is possible to disable automatic
type casting by setting ``auto_cast=False``. For example, by default auto
casting is enabled and *'lat'* and *'long'* will be cast to ``float``,

.. doctest::

  >>> ergast.get_circuits(season=2022, result_type='raw')[0]['Location']
  {'lat': -37.8497, 'long': 144.968, 'locality': 'Melbourne', 'country': 'Australia'}

but with ``auto_cast=False`` both values remain ``str``.

.. doctest::

  >>> ergast.get_circuits(season=2022, result_type='raw', auto_cast=False)[0]['Location']
  {'lat': '-37.8497', 'long': '144.968', 'locality': 'Melbourne', 'country': 'Australia'}

The documentation for each API endpoint includes an "API Mapping" that
shows the structure of the raw response, the updated key names for flattening
and the data types for automatic type casting. Additionally, there is a
"DataFrame Description" that shows which column names will be present in the
result frame. This way it easy to see which keys are renamed.
Additionally, both the "API Mapping" and the "DataFrame Description" will
show the data type to which a value is cast when ``auto_cast=True``.

.. note::
  ``-1`` is used to indicate missing values for ``int``-type values (``int``
  does not support a proper ``NaN`` value)

MultiResponse DataFrames
::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are API endpoints that return complex data structures as a
response. When 'pandas' is selected as result type, these endpoints return a
:class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastMultiResponse`. One such endpoint is
the constructor standings endpoint.

.. TODO: the following doctests are skipped because of the broken Ergast API

.. doctest::

  >>> standings = ergast.get_constructor_standings()  # doctest: +SKIP

Called without any 'season' specifier, it returns standings for multiple
seasons. An overview over the returned data is available as a ``.description``
of the response:

.. doctest::

  >>> standings.description  # doctest: +SKIP
     season  round
  0    1958     11
  1    1959      9
  2    1960     10


Note that the API always returns results in an ascending order.
Therefore, when no season is specified, the constructor standings are returned
for the oldest available seasons.

Due to the maximum number of returned results being limited, only data for
three seasons is returned, as can be seen.

The actual standings information is available in separate DataFrames for
each season. These can be accessed as ``.content`` of the response.
The first element in ``.content`` is associated with the first row of the
``.description`` and so on.

.. doctest::

  >>> standings.content[0]  # doctest: +SKIP
     position positionText  ...  constructorName  constructorNationality
  0         1            1  ...          Vanwall                 British
  1         2            2  ...          Ferrari                 Italian
  ...
  7         8            8  ...        Connaught                 British
  8         9            9  ...             OSCA                 Italian
  <BLANKLINE>
  [9 rows x 8 columns]

Pagination
::::::::::

All Ergast response objects inherit from
:class:`~fastf1.ergast.interface.ErgastResponseMixin`. This object provides
support for pagination on all response objects. Ergast uses pagination
to serve results for specific requests on multiple 'pages' when the response
exceeds the limit for the maximum number of results.

For example, when limiting the sesason list to three results, Ergast
responds with:

.. doctest::

  >>> seasons = ergast.get_seasons(limit=3)
  >>> seasons
     season                                          seasonUrl
  0    1950  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Formula_One...
  1    1951  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Formula_One...
  2    1952  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Formula_One...

It is possible to check whether a response contains all results and to obtain
the total number of results:

.. doctest::

  >>> seasons.is_complete
  False
  >>> seasons.total_results # doctest: +SKIP
  74

Now, the builtin pagination can be used to obtain the next result page. The
same limit as before is used.

.. doctest::

  >>> seasons.get_next_result_page()
     season                                          seasonUrl
  0    1953  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Formula_One...
  1    1954  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Formula_One...
  2    1955  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Formula_One...

It is also possible to manually specify an offset into the dataset:

.. doctest::

  >>> ergast.get_seasons(limit=3, offset=6)
     season                                          seasonUrl
  0    1956  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Formula_One...
  1    1957  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Formula_One...
  2    1958  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Formula_One...

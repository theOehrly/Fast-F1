Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fix incorrect lap number (zero instead of one) for generated laps that are
  added when a driver crashes on the very first lap.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Methods :meth:`fastf1.core.Lap.get_telemetry` and
  :meth:`fastf1.core.Laps.get_telemetry` now take an additional ``frequency``
  keyword argument to override the default frequency that is used for
  resampling.

What's new in v3.2.1
--------------------

(released 05/02/2024)


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a bug that caused timestamps of telemetry data to have (apparent)
  microseconds precision (even though this is not the case). As a result,
  merging position data and car data did not have a well matching timestamp
  index resulting in additional interpolated values. This problem only occurred
  in combination with recent versions of Pandas.

Other
^^^^^

- Various changes to address deprecations in Pandas.


What's new in v3.2.0
--------------------

(released 07/01/2024)


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for Pandas version v2.1.0 and higher.

- Methods :meth:`fastf1.core.Lap.get_telemetry` and
  :meth:`fastf1.core.Laps.get_telemetry` now take an optional additional
  ``frequency`` keyword argument to override the default frequency that is
  used for resampling.

- Added :meth:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_box_laps` to select inlaps and outlaps
  (#454) (by @pesaventofilippo)

- Added the lap number to race control messages, see
  :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.race_control_messages` (#475) (by @manpean)

- Improved lap data integrity checks (#449) (by @d-tomasino)

- Added a string representation for the Cache class that gives information
  about the cache path and the cache size

- Added the function :func:`fastf1.Cache.get_cache_info` that returns
  information about the cache path and the cache size


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed incorrect lap number (zero instead of one) for generated laps that are
  added when a driver crashes on the very first lap

- Fixed :meth:`fastf1.core.Session.get_circuit_info` fails if the default
  resampling frequency for telemetry data is changed (#455)

- Fixed multiple issues with the Ergast API interface that resulted in
  invalid request being made and consequentially no data being returned
  (#489, #494) (by @Lombardoc4)

- Fixed missing driver information for drivers that did not start in a race
  (classified as DNS - did not start) (#447)

- Fixed a regression introduced in v3.1.3 that caused the ``CountryCode``
  to be missing from :class:`fastf1.core.SessionResults`

- Fixed a compatibility issued with Pandas v1.3.5

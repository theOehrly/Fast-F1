v2.0.2: API code overhaul
==========================
This version integrates a major overhaul of the api code (:mod:`fastf1.api`)

- Possibly breaking changes:

  - Renamed dataframe column 'LastLapTime' to 'LapTime' for the dataframe returned by :func:`api.timing_data`
    First, this makes more sense.
    Second, this column is currently already renamed to 'LapTime' later and already accessible under this name
    in the dataframe returned by :func:`core.Session.load_laps`. Therefore the renaming makes the column name
    be consistent between api and core.

    (This also applies to the dictionary returned by the private function :func:`api._laps_data_driver`),

  - Data types in dataframes may have changed

  - Some private functions (prefixed by '_') may have a different name, parameters and return value now

- Changes:
  - rewrote large parts of :mod:`fastf1.api` with a somewhat cleaner implementation

    - more stability

    - better/more correct PitIn/PitOut and general lap data in some sessions (was missing last lap sometimes but had
      a first lap that didn't actually exist

    - api.timing_data and thereby also session.load_laps will raise api.SessionNotAvailableError
      if the api request returned no data. This usually happens if the session never took place because it was cancelled.

    - Attempted to fix a bug where timing data from two sources can not be merged. This is caused by the received API
      data going backwards in time by one lap. This causes data to be added to the wrong lap.
      This problem was the reason for having patch files for some drivers/sessions. The patch files have now been
      removed as they are no longer necessary.

    - improved documentation a bit

  - light cleanup and light documentation improvements of :mod:`fastf1.core`

  - suppressed python-levenshtein warning; it is really not necessary to have it installed for this module

  - changed logging format for hopefully better readability

  - tried to fix lap time axis again; hopefully this time I got it right

========
Features
========

- Access to F1 timing data, telemetry, sessions results and more
- Full support for the Ergast compatible `jolpica-f1 <https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/blob/main/docs/README.md>`_ API to access current and
  historical F1 data
- All data is provided in the form of extended Pandas DataFrames to make
  working with the data easy while having powerful tools available
- Adds custom functions to the Pandas objects specifically to make working
  with F1 data quick and simple
- Integration with Matplotlib to facilitate data visualization
- Implements caching for all API requests to speed up your scripts


..
    To get a quick overview over how to use FastF1, check out
    :doc:`examples/index` or the :doc:`gen_modules/examples_gallery/index`.

    Note that FastF1 handles big chunks of data (~50-100mb per session). To improve
    performance, data is per default cached locally. The default placement
    of the cache is operating system specific. A custom location can be set if
    desired. For more information see :class:`~fastf1.req.Cache`.


Third-party packages
--------------------

- R package that wraps FastF1: https://cran.r-project.org/package=f1dataR

These packages are not directly related to the FastF1 project. Questions and
suggestions regarding these packages need to be directed at their respective
maintainers.

If you want to support the continuous development of FastF1, you can sponsor me
on GitHub or buy me a coffee.


==============
Available Data
==============

The following is a short overview over the available data with some references
to functions and objects used to work with this data.

In most cases, the default workflow with FastF1 is to create a
:class:`~fastf1.core.Session` object using :func:`~fastf1.get_session`. You,
will then access all data through the session object. One notable exception to
this pattern is the wrapper for Ergast.

Compatibility and Availability
------------------------------

Timing data, session information, car telemetry and position data are available
from 2018 onwards. (This data is usually available within 30-120 minutes after
the end of a session.)
It is also possible to obtain this data by recording the data live stream,
using the live timing recorder that is built into FastF1. Usually this is not
necessary but there have been server issues in the past which caused the
data to be not available for download. Recording of the data live stream is
therefore mostly a solution for redundancy.

Schedule information and session results are available for older seasons as
well, going back as far as 1950 (limited to data that is available through
`Ergast <https://ergast.com/mrd/>`_).
